# 💯 100 Days of Code Log – Ankit Chamke

## 🎯 Main Target
I will code for at least **one hour every day for the next 100 days** to improve my development skills, build real projects, and stay consistent.

This challenge is inspired by [Alexander Kallaway](https://github.com/Kallaway "Alexander Kallaway")’s #100DaysOfCode initiative.

which I discovered through [Ayush Bante's](https://github.com/ayushAB) GitHub repo.

- Understood that Linux is the **kernel** and is often bundled with **GNU** tools to form a complete operating system.
- Learned about the open-source philosophy of Linux, which has driven its rapid development and widespread adoption.
- Differentiated between Linux distributions and their purpose, noting how they bundle the kernel and tools for different use cases.
- Gained a foundational understanding of the **Command Line Interface (CLI)** and its importance for speed, automation, and universal control in Linux.

### 📌 Notes
- If I miss a day, I won’t quit — I’ll make it up the next day. The goal is **consistency**, not perfection.
- Projects, practice problems, or even learning new concepts all count as valid coding activity.
- I’ll also explore small freelance-style projects as I gain confidence.
