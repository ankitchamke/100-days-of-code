## üéØ Main Target
I will code for at least **one hour every day for the next 100 days** to improve my development skills, build real projects, and stay consistent.

This challenge is inspired by [Alexander Kallaway](https://github.com/Kallaway "Alexander Kallaway")‚Äôs #100DaysOfCode initiative.

which I discovered through [Ayush Bante's](https://github.com/ayushAB) GitHub repo.
