# ðŸ’¯ 100 Days of Code Log â€“ Ankit Chamke

## ðŸŽ¯ Main Target
I will code for at least **one hour every day for the next 100 days** to improve my development skills, build real projects, and stay consistent.

This challenge is inspired by [Alexander Kallaway](https://github.com/Kallaway "Alexander Kallaway")â€™s #100DaysOfCode initiative.

which I discovered through [Ayush Bante's](https://github.com/ayushAB) GitHub repo.

- **VS Code** â€“ Code editor
- **Git & GitHub** â€“ Version control and daily logs
- **Markdown** â€“ To maintain this log

### ðŸ“Œ Notes
- If I miss a day, I wonâ€™t quit â€” Iâ€™ll make it up the next day. The goal is **consistency**, not perfection.
- Projects, practice problems, or even learning new concepts all count as valid coding activity.
- Iâ€™ll also explore small freelance-style projects as I gain confidence.
