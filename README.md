### ðŸ“Œ Notes
- If I miss a day, I wonâ€™t quit â€” Iâ€™ll make it up the next day. The goal is **consistency**, not perfection.
- Projects, practice problems, or even learning new concepts all count as valid coding activity.
- Iâ€™ll also explore small freelance-style projects as I gain confidence.
